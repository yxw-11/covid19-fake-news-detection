# covid19-fake-news-detection
From the past year, the whole world has gone through
the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter, Facebook, Insta-
gram and many other social platforms update news
on pandemics every day. In this project, we will fine tune
and add additional layers(LSTM/CNN) to the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model
to train social media news posts, which are already
known for truth or fake, for better recognizing those
possible false news that may appear in the future.
